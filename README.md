# myShell
My own Linux shell

## Overview
This was a great exercise in learning about Linux system calls and process concurrency.  This shell is built to run single word commands (ps, date, etc.), commands with arguments (ps -aux), and commands with input and output redirection (ls > output.txt).  The system calls are run within a child process while the parent process wait for the child to terminate.

## Key Functions
fork()  -  Used to create a concurrent child process.
execvp()  -  Used to execute the system call.  This function takes two arguments: the first is the path to the command and the second is a pointer to a c_string array containing the command and arguments.
dup2() - This is used to redirect the input or output of command when using '<' or '>'.  This takes two arguments, the first is the new file descriptor as an int and the second is the file descriptor to be replaced, as an int.
getInput() - This is a custom function which takes the user's input and parses it into c_strings.  This allows the shell to repackage the commands as needed.
