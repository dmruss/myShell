# myShell
A custom Linux shell written in C++

## Overview
This was a great exercise in learning about Linux system calls and process concurrency.  This shell is built to run single word commands (ps, date, etc.), commands with arguments (ps -aux), and commands with input and output redirection (ls > output.txt).  The system calls are run within a child process while the parent process wait for the child to terminate.

## Key Functions
fork()  -  Used to create a concurrent child process.

execvp()  -  Used to execute the system call.  This function takes two arguments: the first is the path to the command and the second is a pointer to a c_string array containing the command and arguments.

dup2() - This is used to redirect the input or output of command when using '<' or '>'.  This takes two arguments, the first is the new file descriptor as an int and the second is the file descriptor to be replaced, as an int.

getInput() - This is a custom function which takes the user's input and parses it into c_strings.  This allows the shell to repackage the commands as needed.

getPath() - Function to concatenate path with command name or file namespace

buildArgList() - Builds an array of c_strings from the command and each argument.  Also builds a second array of c_strings made from only the command and arguments to the left of a '<'.

forkAndExec() - Where the child processes is created and executed.

execRedirect() - Function to execute commands with redirects (< and >).  This function uses dup2() to change the file descriptor.

## To Run
1) Navigate to folder containing the main.cpp and makefile in a linux environment with Make installed.

2) Type 'make shell' to build

3) Type './shell' to run
